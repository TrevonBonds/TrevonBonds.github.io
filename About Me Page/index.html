            My name is Trevon and I enjoy skateboarding, writing music, listening to music, modifying my car and playing video games in my free
            time. I'm very passionate when it comes to computers. Music is also a huge part of my life. I grew up building computers with my dad.
            I then went on to study Computer Programming, Web Development and Digital Media throughout my years of high school.
            After graduating with High Honor Roll, I proceeded to study Computer Science for a year at Weber State University. I have
            2 kids; Aaliyah, Age 3 and Xyiere, Age 1. I am also married to my beautiful wife, Sierra Allen. Over the course of my professional
            career I have learned many things. From working well as a team to developing my skills in communication. I've done retail, which taught 
            me time management and problem solving, customer support representative for Sony Playstaion, as well as StubHub, I've worked as a 
            Paint Specialist for PPG Industries and learned how to work with colors, I've worked in fast food and production so I've learned to work
            in a fast paced environment, and I've worked as a tire mechanic to broaden my horizons when it came to working on my own vehicle.
            Even though none of those career paths helped develop my skills in Computer Science, I've never lost the passion and drive for it.
            Working with technology and being able to be creative and design something that might help and change a lot of lives has been my motivation
            behind working with computers. When I was 15 I had an idea to develop a prgram that would backtrack Crypto currency when it came to the Dark Web.
            I'm a very passionate individual and when I put my mind to something, I'm dedicated. I'm a hard worker and I am a huge people person.
